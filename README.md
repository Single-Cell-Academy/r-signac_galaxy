# Introduction
This repository contains code for Galaxy wrappers for the r-signac package to analyze scATAC-seq data.  !!! This package is currently in open development so check back recently to find new functions integrated. All functions will be available via the Galaxy test and main toolsheds once completed. !!!

# Processing raw ATAC-seq data
To process your raw scATAC-seq fastq files, you can use CellRanger-ATAC, either from the command line or you can use our CellRanger-ATAC galaxy tool, which you can find here:
